**Title:** [Primed and ready: Nanopore metabarcoding can now recover highly accurate consensus barcodes that are generally indel-free](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.552069v1.full)

**Description:** Sequencing of zooplankton samples to recover molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs). At the sample-level, Illumina metabarcoding recovered more MOTUs than nanopore.

**Platforms:** Illumina MiSeq and ONT's minION (R10.3 chemistry)

#

**Title:** [Performance analysis of conventional and AI-based variant callers using short and long reads](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.12.544612v2)

**Platforms:** Illumina HiSeq2500

#

**Title:** [The long and short of it: Benchmarking viromics using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.12.527533v1)

**Description:** Assessment of assembly algorithms for the analysis of viromes (mock community of 15 bacteriophage genomes), and assessment of error rates across different platforms.

**Platforms:** Illumina MiSeq (NexteraXT library prep kit), minION (library prep by SQK-LSK109), and PacBio Sequel.

## 2022

**Title:** [Sequencing of individual barcoded cDNAs on Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore reveals platform-specific error patterns](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.17.476636v1)

**Description:** Isoform analysis of mouse data via sequencing cDNA of reverse transcription events.

**Platforms:** PacBio Sequel II, and ONT PromethION

**Title:** ðŸ§¬ [Target enrichment long-read sequencing with adaptive sampling can determine the structure of the small supernumerary marker chromosomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s10038-021-01004-x)

**Description:** Comparative analysis of two clinical samples

**Platforms:** HiSeq 1500 (2â€‰Ã—â€‰101â€‰bp) and, ONT's GridION using R9.4.1 flowcell (ligation sequencing kit SQK-LSK109)

**Title:** ðŸ§¬ [An assessment of bioinformatics tools for the detection of human endogenous retroviral insertions in short-read genome sequencing data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.18.481042v1)

**Description:** Analysis of 50 human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) short-read whole-genome sequences, "matching long and short read data, and simulated short-read data."

**Platforms:** Illumina HiSeq 2000 and 2500, and PacBio Sequel
