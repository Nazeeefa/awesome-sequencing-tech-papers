Using both PacBio Hi-Fi and ONT datasets, the study shows that the algorithm identifies more true SVs in repetitive and low-mappability regions while maintaining precision. It also reports stable performance across different coverages and error profiles, with particularly strong gains in recall on ONT data and balanced accuracy on Hi-Fi reads. The results indicate that the approach adapts well to the strengths and limitations of each long-read platform.  | PacBio (Hi-Fi, CCS) and ONT long reads |

The study evaluates per-site accuracy, genomic-context performance, and how much methylation calls improve with latest ONT R10.4 chemistry + base-calling.                                               | ONT (R10.4 flowcell) vs PacBio (SMRT) + oxBS reference |

The study demonstrates that ONT can achieve near-complete genome reconstruction, with assembly quality and methylated-motif detection comparable to PacBio. It suggests that ONT is a cost-effective stand-alone solution for bacterial genome assembly.                                                               | ONT (R10.4.1 / V14 / duplex) vs PacBio (SMRT) ± Illumina |

It shows that both platforms can yield comparable contiguity; PacBio excels in phasing accuracy, ONT Duplex in contiguity.        | PacBio (HiFi) and ONT (Duplex + ultra-long)                                                                              |

Although PacBio data is not newly generated here, the study’s benchmarking shows how ONT assemblies can approach “near-perfect” accuracy.                                  | ONT (raw assemblies) per-base error correction benchmark (implicit comparison to high-fidelity long-read expectations) |

ONT assembly had much fewer contigs (18, with 10 chromosome-level) compared to PacBio (394 contigs, 3 chromosome-level). The study highlights that PacBio assembly suffered errors in long repetitive regions (false redundancies, losses), which ONT ultralong reads avoided, highlighting trade-offs between contiguity vs per-base accuracy.         | ONT ultralong reads vs PacBio HiFi (CCS) on Sequel II                                                                           |

The study evaluates taxonomic resolution (genus/species), relative abundance, and community composition. Both long-read platforms outperform Illumina in species-level resolution; ONT showed somewhat higher species-level classification (76%) vs PacBio (63%).       | PacBio Hi-Fi vs ONT MinION full-length 16S ± Illumina MiSeq                                                                             |
